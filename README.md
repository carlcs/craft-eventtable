# Event Table plugin for Craft

![Event Table](https://github.com/carlcs/craft-eventtable/blob/master/eventtable.png)

Adds a new field type to Craft: "Event Table". It builds upon Craft's Table field type, where multiple rows of content can be entered into table columns defined in the field settings.

In addition to the types of content available with the default Table field (Single-line text, Multi-line text, Number and Checkbox), "Event Table" allows you to configure Date, Time and Date/Time type columns.

## Installation

To install the plugin, copy the eventtable/ folder into craft/plugins/. Then go to Settings â†’ Plugins and click the "Install" button next to "Event Table".
